Dive into iExec and private cloud computation 

##Install the SDK 

The iExec SDK and API provide a set of tools that allows all users to easily interact with iExec decentralized marketplace.

### install 

## What is wallet 
The cryptocurrency wallet is a secure software program to interact with blockchains.
The wallet enables user to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance and conduct other operations as smart contract.

iExec service runs on ethereum blockchain, the deal between agents (data owner, resources provider, developer and end users) are made using RLC token.

This transaction execution (smart contract) takes some amount of gas in ETH,
this gas is used to calculate the amount of fees that need to be paid to the network in order to execute an operation.

## Charge your wallet  

##The application

### The software: Nilearn 

Nilearn is a Python module for fast and easy statistical learning on NeuroImaging data.

<https://nilearn.github.io/>

It leverages the scikit-learn Python toolbox for multivariate statistics with applications 
such as predictive modelling, classification, decoding, or connectivity analysis.

### The application

the application consists in plotting a statistical maps to measure the brain activity

The second plot applies a threeshold to hightlighs the more active area  

more details in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parametric_mapping

The data are available at www.neurovault.com, a public repository of unthresholded statistical maps, 
parcellations, and atlases of the brain


Nilearn software will download the input data if it is present on the current 

### Why data matters?   

  Medical data are sensitive.
      

## Intro to SGX

iExec provides a full end to end data protection for blockchain-based computation using Intel® SGX.

End-to-end protection means full protection of the application data, user data, embedded data as well as application output data.

Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a technology that runs code and data in CPU-hardened “enclaves” or a ‘Trusted Execution Environment’ (TEE).

The enclave is a trusted area of memory where critical aspects of the application functionality are protected, helping keep code and data confidential and unmodified.

Your account must be topped up with RLC in order to trigger the execution of an application.



  
### Prepare the dAPP, 
- dockerize
  iExec supports dockerized application, 
- no gui   
- data input
    
### Run the dApp

```
    cp iexec-rlc.blend ./tee/inputs
```

### Run the dApp with privacy preserving
   -customize the docker
   -encrypt the data
   -custom the execution
